- 👋 Hi, I’m a mathematician working in representation theory.
- 👀 I’m interested in geometric deep learning, equivariance in neural nets and applications of representation theory to deep learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning non Euclidean manifold learning. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above. I have many ideas I could contribute!
